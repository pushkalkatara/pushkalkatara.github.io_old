<p>POV display spins 360 degrees. The purpose of POV display project is to create a small apparatus that will create a visual using only a small number of LEDs as it spins in a circle. When the LEDs rotate several times around a point in less than a second, the human eye reaches its limit of motion perception and creates an illusion of a continuous image. I built this as a fun project in my 1st semester of college.

<p>The pictures generated by the spinning LEDs are coordinated by an Arduino UNO microcontroller. A Hall Effect sensor is used in conjunction with a strong magnet so that the microcontroller can receive a reference point as to when it should start outputting the visual during each rotation. The RPM of motor, diameter of LEDâ€™s decides the POV phenomena.</p>
