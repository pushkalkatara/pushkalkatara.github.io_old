URSim is a 3D underwater simulation framework for Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) developed using ROS and Unity3D. Worked in collaboration with team SRMAUV for AUV's simulation and published as a paper in 2019 IEEE Symposium on Underwater Technology. 2019/04/16-19 @NSYSU, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. <br />

It is capable of simulating feedback control systems, dynamic model, underwater vision and mission planning for underwater vehicles. The simulation provides support for underwater sensor modules, underwater physics, collision kinematics and is highly configurable to simulate a realistic underwater environment. The software architecture is adaptive to algorithms for control systems, image processing, navigation and manipulation.
