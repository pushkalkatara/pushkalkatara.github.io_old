Worked with organization JdeRobot on VisualStates, developing a tool for programming robot behaviors using Finite State Machines. It generates ROS node as output, in C++ or Python, which connects to the configured robot drivers at runtime.  <br />

- Implemented recursive automata import functionality and global-local namespace as new features to the tool. Wrote documentation, articles and worked in collaboration with mentors through weekly video sessions and daily emails. Developed simulation examples in Gazebo simulator using computer vision and sensor manipulation algorithms using Toyota Prius Car for autonomous navigation.

- More details coming soon :D
